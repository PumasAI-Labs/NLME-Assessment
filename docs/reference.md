## Key Points

- You can fit multiple models with a single `Population` by calling the `fit` function with different arguments
- The `inspect` function calculates in one go preds, ipreds, wres, ebes, icoefs, and dose control parameters, if applicable for any fitted Pumas model
- You can convert any output of an `inspect` into a NM-TRAN-formatted `DataFrame`
- Everything that `inspect` computes can be individually computed using specific functions if necessary

## Glossary

pred

: Population predictions, i.e. predictions using only the fixed effects and without random effects.

ipred

: Individual predictions, i.e. predictions using the fixed effects and random effects.

wres

: Weighted residuals. They are the difference between observed data and the predicted data. In other words, it's a measure of the error in the prediction. But weighted by the precision of the observations, i.e. they are divided by the standard deviation of the observations.

ebe

: Empirical Bayes estimates. They are commonly known as the individual parameters, or, also known as the "etas" (Î·).

icoef

: Individual coefficients. They are calculated using the population coefficients and the individual parameters.

dose control parameters

: Parameters that govern the dosage regimen of a drug, and the associated pharmacokinetic properties of the drug in the body. In Pumas models they are: lag of the dose, bioavability of the dose, rate of dosing, and duration of the dosing.

NM-TRAN

: Official NONMEM dataset format. Check [Pumas documentation on Data Representation](https://docs.pumas.ai/stable/basics/data_representation) for more information.
